""" Assignment 2

You will modify Assignment 1 to support cosine similarity queries.

The documents are read from documents.txt.

The index will store tf-idf values using the formulae from class.

The search method will sort documents by the cosine similarity between the
query and the document (normalized only by the document length, not the query
length, as in the examples in class).

The search method also supports a use_champion parameter, which will use a
champion list (with threshold 10) to perform the search.
